Feature: Reporting Unhandled exceptions in a rest controller

Scenario: Report an exception from a spring boot rest controller
    When I run spring boot "RestControllerScenario" with the defaults
    Then I should receive a request
    And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
    And the request used the Spring notifier
    And the "Bugsnag-API-Key" header equals "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
    And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 element
    And the event "unhandled" is true
    And the event "severity" equals "error"
    And the event "context" equals "GET /send-unhandled-exception"
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "java.lang.RuntimeException"
    And the exception "message" equals "Unhandled exception from TestRestController"
    And the event "metaData.request.url" ends with "/send-unhandled-exception"
    And the event "severityReason.type" equals "unhandledExceptionMiddleware"
    And the event "severityReason.attributes.framework" equals "Spring"

Scenario: Report an exception from a plain spring rest controller
    Given I run the plain spring app
    When I navigate to the route "/mazerunnerplainspring/send-unhandled-exception" on port "1235"
    Then I should receive a request
    And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
    And the request used the Spring notifier
    And the "Bugsnag-API-Key" header equals "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
    And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 element
    And the event "unhandled" is true
    And the event "severity" equals "error"
    And the event "context" equals "GET /mazerunnerplainspring/send-unhandled-exception"
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "java.lang.RuntimeException"
    And the exception "message" equals "Unhandled exception from TestRestController"
    And the event "metaData.request.url" ends with "/send-unhandled-exception"
    And the event "severityReason.type" equals "unhandledExceptionMiddleware"
    And the event "severityReason.attributes.framework" equals "Spring"
