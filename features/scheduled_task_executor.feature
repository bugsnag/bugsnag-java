Feature: Verifies that unhandled exceptions in scheduled tasks are reported to Bugsnag regardless of Scheduler configuration

Scenario: By default a single-threaded ThreadPoolTaskScheduler is used
    When I run spring boot "ScheduledTaskScenario" with the defaults
    Then I should receive a request
    And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
    And the exception "message" equals "Unhandled exception from ScheduledTaskService"

Scenario: A TaskScheduler supplied as a bean is used
    Given I set environment variable "custom_task_scheduler_bean" to "true"
    And I run spring boot "ScheduledTaskScenario" with the defaults
    Then I should receive a request
    And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
    And the exception "message" equals "Unhandled exception from ScheduledTaskService"

Scenario: A ScheduledExecutorService supplied as a bean is used
    Given I set environment variable "scheduled_executor_service_bean" to "true"
    And I run spring boot "ScheduledTaskScenario" with the defaults
    Then I should receive a request
    And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
    And the exception "message" equals "Unhandled exception from ScheduledTaskService"

Scenario: For multiple ScheduledExecutorService beans, the one named "taskScheduler" is used
    Given I set environment variable "scheduled_executor_service_bean" to "true"
    And I set environment variable "other_scheduled_executor_service_bean" to "true"
    And I run spring boot "ScheduledTaskScenario" with the defaults
    Then I should receive a request
    And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
    And the exception "message" equals "Unhandled exception from ScheduledTaskService"

Scenario: For multiple TaskScheduler beans, the one named "taskScheduler" is used
    Given I set environment variable "custom_task_scheduler_bean" to "true"
    Given I set environment variable "second_task_scheduler_bean" to "true"
    And I run spring boot "ScheduledTaskScenario" with the defaults
    Then I should receive a request
    And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
    And the exception "message" equals "Unhandled exception from ScheduledTaskService"

Scenario: Scheduled tasks execute on a ScheduledExecutorService rather than a single-threaded Executor, when available
    Given I set environment variable "scheduled_executor_service_bean" to "true"
    And I run spring boot "ScheduledTaskExecutorScenario" with the defaults
    Then I should receive a request
    And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
    And the event "metaData.executor.multiThreaded" is true
