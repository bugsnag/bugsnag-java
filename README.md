Bugsnag Notifier for Java [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bugsnag/bugsnag-java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bugsnag/bugsnag-java)
=========================

The Bugsnag Notifier for Java gives you instant notification of exceptions
thrown from your Java applications. The notifier hooks into
`Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler`, so any uncaught exceptions in your app will
be sent to your Bugsnag dashboard.

[Bugsnag](https://bugsnag.com) captures errors in real-time from your websites
and mobile applications, helping you to understand and resolve them
as fast as possible. [Create a free account](https://bugsnag.com) to start
capturing errors from your applications.

Getting Started
---------------

### Installation

#### Using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) (Recommended)

1.  Add `bugsnag` as a dependency in your `pom.xml`

    ```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.bugsnag</groupId>
      <artifactId>bugsnag</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

2.  Install the package

    ```shell
    $ mvn install
    ```

#### Manual Jar Installation

1.  Download the [latest bugsnag.jar](http://bugsnagcdn.s3.amazonaws.com/bugsnag-java/bugsnag-2.0.0.jar)
    and place it in your app's classpath.

    Bugsnag for Java depends only on the `org.json` library,
    [download the jar here](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/json/json/20090211/json-20090211.jar).


### Configuration

Import the Bugsnag `Client` class in your code and create an instance to
begin capturing exceptions:

```java
import com.bugsnag.Client;
Client bugsnag = new Client("your-api-key-goes-here");
```


Sending Custom Data With Exceptions
-----------------------------------

It is often useful to send additional meta-data about your app, such as
information about the currently logged in user, along with any exceptions,
to help debug problems. To add custom data to every exception you can
use `addToTab`:

```java
bugsnag.addToTab("User", "Name", "Bob Hoskins");
bugsnag.addToTab("User", "Paying Customer?", true);
```


Send Non-Fatal Exceptions to Bugsnag
------------------------------------

If you would like to send non-fatal exceptions to Bugsnag, you can pass any
`Throwable` object to the `notify` method:

```java
bugsnag.notify(new RuntimeException("Non-fatal"));
```

You can also send additional meta-data with your exception:

```java
import com.bugsnag.MetaData;

MetaData metaData = new MetaData();
metaData.addToTab("User", "username", "bob-hoskins");
metaData.addToTab("User", "email", "bob@example.com");

bugsnag.notify(new RuntimeException("Non-fatal"), metaData);
```

### Severity

You can set the severity of an error in Bugsnag by including the severity option when
notifying bugsnag of the error,

```java
bugsnag.notify(new RuntimeException("Non-fatal"), "error")
```

Valid severities are `error`, `warning` and `info`.

Severity is displayed in the dashboard and can be used to filter the error list.
By default all crashes (or unhandled exceptions) are set to `error` and all
`bugsnag.notify` calls default to `warning`.


Additional Configuration
------------------------

###setContext

Bugsnag uses the concept of "contexts" to help display and group your
errors. Contexts represent what was happening in your application at the
time an error occurs.

```java
bugsnag.setContext("MyActivity");
```

###setUser

Bugsnag helps you understand how many of your users are affected by each
error. In order to do this, we need to send along user information with every
exception.

If you would like to enable this, set the `user`. You can set the user id,
which should be the unique id to represent that user across all your apps,
the user's email address and the user's name:

```java
bugsnag.setUser("userId", "user@email.com", "User Name");
```

###setReleaseStage

If you would like to distinguish between errors that happen in different
stages of the application release process (development, production, etc)
you can set the `releaseStage` that is reported to Bugsnag.

```java
bugsnag.setReleaseStage("development");
```

By default this is set to be "production".

###setNotifyReleaseStages

By default, we will notify Bugsnag of exceptions that happen in any
`releaseStage`. If you would like to change which release stages notify
Bugsnag of exceptions you can call `setNotifyReleaseStages`:

```java
bugsnag.setNotifyReleaseStages(new String[]{"production", "development"});
```

###setEndpoint

By default, we will send errors to your bugsnag.com dashboard. If you are using
*Bugsnag Enterprise* you'll need to call `setEndpoint` to specify errors be sent
to your Bugsnag Enterprise endpoint:

```java
bugsnag.setEndpoint("bugsnag.internal.example.com:49000");
```

###setAutoNotify

By default, we will automatically notify Bugsnag of any fatal exceptions
in your application. If you want to stop this from happening, you can call
`setAutoNotify`:

```java
bugsnag.setAutoNotify(false);
```

###setFilters

Sets the strings to filter out from the `extraData` maps before sending
them to Bugsnag. Use this if you want to ensure you don't send
sensitive data such as passwords, and credit card numbers to our
servers. Any keys which contain these strings will be filtered.

```java
bugsnag.setFilters(new String[]{"password", "credit_card_number"});
```

By default, `filters` is set to `new String[] {"password"};`

<div id="set-project-root"></div>
###setProjectPackages

Sets which package names Bugsnag should consider as "inProject". We mark
stacktrace lines as in-project if they originate from any of these
packages.

```java
bugsnag.setProjectPackages("com.company.package1", "com.company.package2");
```

### setProxy

Sets the proxy to use when sending requests to Bugsnag.com.

```java
bugsnag.setProxy(new Proxy(Proxy.Type.HTTP, new InetSocketAddress("example.com", 80));
```

### setUseSSL

Set whether communication with Bugsnag.com should be made via SSL. To use HTTP set it to false.

```java
bugsnag.setUseSSL(false);
```

###setAsynchronousNotification

Sets whether error notifications to Bugsnag.com are sent asynchronously.

By default `asynchronousNotification` is set to `true`.

```java
bugsnag.setAsynchronousNotification(false);
```

###setIgnoreClasses

Sets for which exception classes we should not send exceptions to Bugsnag.

```java
bugsnag.setIgnoreClasses("java.io.IOException", "com.example.Custom");
```

###setSendThreads

Sets if we should collect and send thread state along with errors.

Bt default `sendThreads` is set to `false`.

```java
bugsnag.setSendThreads(true);
```

###addBeforeNotify

Adds a callback, in which to invoke directly before the notifier sends the
error to the specified endpoint (ie. Bugsnag.com). This callback has full
read/write access to the error object, so it has the opportunity to prevent
the error from being sent all together.

The callback does not get invoked if the Exception name has been set to
ignored via [setIgnoreClasses](#setignoreclasses).

By returning `false` from this callback, the Bugsnag notifier will prevent
sending the error to the Bugsnag endpoint. The first callback to return
`false` will prevent all other subsequent callbacks from being invoked.

```java
bugsnag.addBeforeNotify(new BeforeNotify() {
    @Override
    public boolean run(Error error) {
        // Sets the groupingHash option
        error.setGroupingHash("hello");

        // Overrides the severity
        error.setSeverity("warning");

        // Modifies the user information
        error.addToTab("user", "id", 1337);

        // Prevents the error from being sent
        return false;
    }
});
```

Error Object
------------

###setGroupingHash

Sets the `groupingHash` used by Bugsnag.com to manually override the default
grouping technique. This option is not recommended, and should be used carefully
when used.

Any errors that are sent to Bugsnag, that have the same `groupingHash` will
be grouped as one. As the name implies, this option accepts a hash of sorts.

```java
// ... generate the hash
String groupingHash = "f8803769f3e293dfcabdb6dec5100b8c52c6ae6b";

error.setGroupingHash(groupingHash);
```

###addToTab

Sets a piece of information to be displayed in the Bugsnag.com error page. The
first argument is the tab name, the second argument is the key for the data, and
the third argument is used as the value.

```java
error.addToTab("user", "role", "Administrator");
```

###setSeverity

Overrides the severity of the error. See the [Severity](#severity) section for
valid options.

```java
error.setSeverity("warning");
```

###getException

Returns the thrown `Throwable`.

###getExceptionName

Returns the full name of the `Throwable`.

###getStackTrace

Returns the `Throwable`'s array of `StackTraceElement`s.
